# RU Water Fountains

A map that displays water fountains across the Rutgers-New Brunswick campus.
Rutgers students can use their ScarletMail to submit a location and description of a fountain that does not appear on the map, and the request will be reviewed and approved by a site admin. Existing foundations can be edited if they are inaccurate.
